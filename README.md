# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Shopping Cart System
This project is a console-based e-commerce shopping cart system built using object-oriented principles and clean code practices. It models the fundamental components of an online shopping platform including customers, products (digital, shippable, and expirable), and a shipping service.
---

### ðŸ“Œ Features
- Add and remove products from the cart
- Handle different product types:
  - DigitalProduct
  - ShippableProduct
  - ExpirableProduct
  - ShippableAndExpirableProduct
- Calculate subtotal, shipping fees, and total paid amount
- Validate customer balance before checkout
- Ship physical products using a shipping service
- Interfaces used to define extensible contracts (e.g., IShippable, IExpirable, IShippingService)
---

### âœ… Design Highlights
- Interface Segregation: Products implement only the interfaces relevant to them (IShippable, IExpirable)
- Dependency Inversion: ShippingService depends on abstractions (IShippable)
- Encapsulation & Modularity: Each class has a focused responsibility
- Extendable: Easily add new types of products or services
